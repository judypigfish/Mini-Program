# Merge File
This is a program that hides one file into another file.

## Steps to use
1. Select a file to serve as the visible one, for instance, a .jpg file.
2. Choose a file you want to conceal, any file type is acceptable, such as a .rar file.
3. Select the destination path for saving the file.
4. Input the desired name for the output file, ensuring to include the file extension. It's recommended to align the extension with that chosen in step 1.
